# SOLID Principles for C# Developers

A clone of the sample application used to demonstrate SOLID principles for the Pluralsight course, [SOLID Principles for C# Developers](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/csharp-solid-principles) by Steve Smith (Ardalis).

## Usage Instructions

The `ArdelisRating` project shows the *initial* code used in the course. It's the starting point. 

The `ArdelisRatingWithSolid` project shows my implementation of all of the principles as I go along with the course.


The sample code was written using [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.com/). You can download the free Community edition which should work fine with this code. Alternately, you can use Visual Studio Code or another editor you prefer.
